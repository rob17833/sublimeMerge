The first thing you have t know is that this sublime version
already provide diff integration.

What's diff integration?
well let's say you create a new file like this one, you start typing some lines
and you will see an orange line appears in the margin that tells you these lines
didn't exist before, there are new lines 
then of course as usual you will ctrl s to save your document, however the orange indicator in the margin is still there !

THE ORANGE MARKER IN THE LEFT MARGIN SHOWS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS FILE NOW AND
THE THIS FILE WHEN IT HAS BEEN OPENED !
IN OTHER WORDS, THESE ARE NEW LINES FROM THE LAST TIME YOU CLOSED YOUR DOCUMENT.

Now if you close your file and open it again this orange marker will have disappeared
and if you open the menu looking for Diff Hunk, well basically this option won't 
appears.

Write new lines and you will be able so display the Diff Hunk again.

So this is a new feature in sublime text that allows you to see the diffs even though
your file IS NOT FOLLOWED BY GIT.

Try it again and again to be sure you have understand it!

You can also call this menu in order to see which lines ARE NOT BEEN SAVED.

And try it again !

There are different colors for diffs:
	orange means modified lines
	green means added lines
	red cursor means deleted lines
YOU CAN LOOP INTO THE MODIFICATIONS BY USING CTRL+. TO SEE THEM

This sublime feature is handfull because whatever changes you make on your file
BEFORE closing this file you can always retrieve the first version of your code !

STEP 2 connect an untracked file to a unexisting repository
step 1 go to the root folder you want to track >>> git init
step 2 create a new repo on gitHub >>> give it a name and an url will be created
step 3 copy the given url
step 4 open sublimeMerge and >>>add remote+nameRepo+urlRepo >>> enter
step 5 fill username+password
Done, this folder is tracked and has a remote repository !

Now open the file in sublimeText.
Nothing has changed however you can see the name of the branch you are on.
SublimeText Diff integration is still working but you don't even notice anything about 
git while typing new lines until you save your file but once you 'ctrl+s' some marks
appears next to the file you just saved (side bar)
A small colored dot in the side bar.
Each time you change your file and you save, it updates sublimeMerge, ready to STAGE
and commit >>> easy peacy ! 
If you stage, all the 'diffs' disappear ! SO THE SUBLIME DIFF FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE
UNTILL YOU STAGE YOUR FILE !  THE GIT MARKS IN THE SIDE BAR AS WELL

YOU DON T NEED TO STAGE UNTILL YOU WANT TO CHECKOUT !
So be sure before STAGE AND COMMIT (unstage is possible)
